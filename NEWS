* Filetemplates
   Filetemplates enables the development of file-based Midgard
   applications. Page & style info is put in XML files. All midgard
   stuff works but you'll be missing some information like
   $midgard->page.

   Filetemplates can work in connected or disconnected mode. Connected
   is if a non-prefixed host record is found for the host you're
   accessing. A connection to the database will be available and all
   midgard functions will work. If not all midgard functions can be
   called but will fail. The template & inline variable expansion
   syntax does work in disconnected mode.
