These are the installation instructions for the Midgard library. The
library allows Midgard applications to access the Midgard database.

The library uses the GNU configure system for configuration and
installation. To install, run:

 $ ./configure
 $ make
 # make install

The Midgard core library depends on quite a few other libraries. See
the below options for documentation on how to tell the configure script
how to find the required dependencies.

  --with-mysql-config=/path/to/mysql_config
                          The mysql_config program is used to set up
                          the include and library options required
                          by the MySQL dependency. Unless you specify
                          the mysql_config location explicity, then
                          the current PATH is searched for the program.

If you are building midgard-lib as a shared library (highly
recommended), make sure to update your environment so it can be found.
For many UNIX-alike systems, this means adding it to LD_LIBRARY_PATH
for the program depending on it. For GNU/Linux systems (maybe others,
let me know) you can add it to /etc/ld.so.conf, and run ldconfig.
You will need to do this before you build the other components, since
they depend on midgard-lib.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Platform notes:

** Solaris
You need gnu make to build apache. Everywhere the documentation says
'make ...' you should probably use 'MAKE=gmake gmake ...'.

Also, midgard-lib calls 'assert' at various places. Yes, I know, we
should remove those at some point. Anyhow, for the time being, if
you're using gcc to compile all this, you'll probably come up short on
__eprintf. This can be found in libgcc.a, you'll have to extract
_eprintf.o and link it into apache. If someone knows how to fix this
in a more convenient way, let us know.
