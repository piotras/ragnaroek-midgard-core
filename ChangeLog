	* Included Emiliano's Workaround for the stale Midgard References
	  into midgard.c. This works around Bug #091, but does not really
	  solve it. We are working on it.

2002-05-17 15:08  Torben Nehmer <torben@nehmer.net>

	* Backported the new PHP UDF Functions from MMP to non-MMP
	  non-MMP now uses the same set of functions
	* During this I've explicitly removed all the old udf-functions
	  from the php4 module
	* Fixed bug that Debian PHP 4.1.x didn't recognize 
	  ${mgd_register_filter('blah')}($var);
	  Workaround uses a second function mgd_execute_udf in the
	  Midgard-Root File
	* Fixed bug that the parser only recognized custom-formatters
	  with name cosisting of only one character. This behavoir
	  wasn't there with the older Midgards. Cause was a wrong
	  regex for the Formatter Definition. (Note: This
	  regex is rather simple, it should be enhanced to allow
	  only the supported Formatters in the first digit.)
	* Changed configure.in to enable eval hacks by default to
	  ensure backwards compatibility.

	* repligard/: export.c, main.c.in, repligard.xml, rpconfig.c,
	rpconfig.h, schema.c: Alan Knowles' patch integrated

	* repligard/: common.c, export.c, import.c, main.c.in, read.c,
	rpconfig.c, rpconfig.h, schema.c: Exit after CRITICAL event

2001-03-07 17:18 David <david@guerizec.net>

	* src/tree_core.c: Added the break-branch-not-entire-tree feature
	for mgd_walk_xxx_tree in straight walking mode (ie. order == 1).
	
	So now, from a user function, a return code of [ - means]:
	>0 - continue, all is ok.
	=0 - there was a fatal error, stop all.  <0 - don't go down in this
	branch, but continue.
	
	This doesn't work on reverse walking mode (for obvious reasons).

2001-03-06 23:49 David <david@guerizec.net>

	* src/tree.c: forgot to fix that file (walk-tree stoppers).

2001-03-06 17:42 David <david@guerizec.net>

	* midgard/midgard.h.in, src/tree_core.c: faster is_in_tree function
	(faster than build_tree, anyway ;)

2001-02-25 19:02 David <david@guerizec.net>

	* src/tree_core.c: tree algorithm bug fixed.  Now there is only one
	adaptive algorithm.  Tested with 21515 nodes (approx. 8 seconds to
	walk the tree) total time: 8 seconds number of nodes: 21515
	Statistics: level 00 001 node level 01 003 nodes level 02 010 nodes

2001-02-22 17:52 Alexander Bokovoy <ab@avilink.net>

	* repligard/export.c: Do not replicate already replicated deleted
	resources.

2001-02-22 17:50 Alexander Bokovoy <ab@avilink.net>

	remove <midgard install dir>/include/mgd_select_db.h remove
	<midgard install dir>/include/mgd_apache.h update lib, mod and php
	(from cvs.php.net if you're using php4) run bootstrap (autoconf

	s/HAVE_SITEGROUPS/HAVE_MIDGARD_SITEGROUPS/g; Replaced ifdef -> if
	because this constant always defined but as 0 or 1

2001-02-15 21:22 Alexander Bokovoy <ab@avilink.net>

	* configure.in, repligard/Makefile.am, repligard/export.c,
	repligard/main.c.in, repligard/rpconfig.c, repligard/rpconfig.h,
	repligard/schema.c, src/midgard.c: - Support for sitegroups in
	Repligard.  - Support for secure configuration file management
	Still to do: - configuration file installation with proper
	permissions - automatic sitegroup links addition into DB structure
	in Repligard

2001-02-13 09:54 David <david@guerizec.net>

	* src/tree.c: fixed bugs #98 and #99

	* src/midgard.c: Bug #83+#84 see (A) lib/midgard.c line #345 (with
	SGs) or #350 (without SGs) for the SQL query see (B) lib/midgard.c
	line #374
	
	with (A) and the following code, the table mgd->member is filled
	with the gids of the groups the user belongs to.  it is then ended
	with a 0 at line (B)
	
	Solution (lib): set an "ORDER BY gid DESC" in query (A).

2001-02-03 16:11 Alexander Bokovoy <ab@avilink.net>

	* repligard/repligard.xml: Group type had bad owner.

2001-01-23 17:40 Alexander Bokovoy <ab@avilink.net>

	* repligard/: export.c, main.c.in, read.c, repligard.conf.in,
	repligard.xml, rpconfig.c, rpconfig.h, schema.c, schema.h: Tree
	export fixes, improvements. Nonreversable fields by Alan Knowles
	added

	libraries if it is required

2001-01-08 15:17 Alexander Bokovoy <ab@avilink.net>

	* repligard/export.c: Multiple dependencies fix

2001-01-06 Alexander Bokovoy <ab@avilink.net>
	* Use 'UCS-2' instead of 'UNICODE' (both are the same, actually)
	  during translation table creation because of compability issues
	  between old/new GLIBC and other platforms.
	  
2000-12-13 Alexander Bokovoy <ab@avilink.net>

	* ICONV support now replaces illegal symbols/sequences by '?'
	  (thanks to Dmitry Levin <ldv@fandra.org>)
	  
	* FT ignores encoding translation when file template misses
	  XML declaration (<?xml version="1.0" encoding="SOME-ENCODING"?>
	  
	* BLOBs should now function when object has been copied by
	  mgd_copy_xxxx functions
	   
2000-12-13 Alexander Bokovoy <ab@avilink.net>
	
	* Repligard supports BLOBs and attachments fully
	
	* FT supports different encodings via iconv(3).
	
2000-11-27 Alexander Bokovoy <ab@avilink.net>

        * Repligard sources merged with Midgard-lib tree.

2000-11-23 10:51  emile

	* mgd_apache.h moved to lib because copying this file was
     cumbersome and error-prone. I use it for php4, and the contents
     of the file _must_ be exactly the same or you'll see hard to
     trace segfaults.

2000-11-02 14:55  emile

	* Be flexible about where expat is located.

2000-10-28 09:05  emile

	* INSTALL: Added reference to expat

2000-10-27 13:37  emile
 
	* midgard.c: Be more strict about SG0. You can no longer log in
	using admin[*!$], instead use admin[*!$]sitegroupname, or admin
	without qualifiers to log in as root in SG0. Additionally, disallow
	the creation od SG0 group records.                                           

2000-10-26 14:05  emile
 
	* configure.in, filetemplate.c: midgard-lib now uses libexpat
	available from http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/ 

2000-10-23 17:32  emile
 
	* format.c: Broken down assert to make it easier to track down
	problems

2000-10-13 Alexander Bokovoy <bokovoy@avilink.net>

	* Repligard functionality re-written.
    
2000-10-04 David Guerizec <david@guerizec.net>

	* Tree management enhanced: blobs and paramaters now can be
	copied and deleted properly
    
2000-10-03 16:07  emile
 
	* format.c: va_arg doesn't know about chars, use int                         

2000-10-03 15:09  emile
 
	* configure.in, midgard.c, midgard.h.in: Security update. It was
	previously possible to log into any site as anonymous (no
	username).                                                                   

2000-09-26 14:43  emiliano
 
	* midgard.c: Logon modifier now defaults to '*' for SG0 sites and
	'+' for others.

2000-09-20 15:07  emiliano
 
	* midgard.c: Wrong reason was reported if the user didn't exist
	within the sitegroup                                                         

2000-07-17 Emile Heyns <emile@iris-advies.com>

	* Filetemplates

2000-07-05 Emile Heyns <emile@iris-advies.com>

	* Sitegroups logon 'su' support

	* Repligard

2000-04-17	Emile Heyns <emile@iris-advies.com>

	* Sitegroups 0.3 beta with improved logon options

	* Calendering/events in the Midgard core

	* Database generalization

        * sitegroup.sql: additional table and column in midgard database
          for SiteGroups

        * format.c midgard.c midgard.h repligard.c tree.c: SiteGroups
          added

2000-02-04  Alexander Bokovoy <bokovoy@minsk.lug.net>

	* tree.c,midgard.h: cleaned up object copying code, functions for
	  moving objects added
	
	* midgard.c: queries wrapped by internal pools in order
	  to allow inherited queries for proper object copying
	
	* configure.in: version changed to 1.2.6-beta2
	
2000-01-29  Alexander Bokovoy <bokovoy@minsk.lug.net>

	* repligard.c: implemented set of functions for accessing
	  database repository info.
	
	* tree.c: functions for traversing/copying/deleting object trees 
	
	* format.c: mgd_free_from_pool() added to allow selective
	  deletion of pool's resources (needed for copying objects)

2000-01-26  Alexander Bokovoy <bokovoy@minsk.lug.net>

	* format.c: Small bug in mgd_alloc() fixed.
	* md5.[ch]: code for MD5 checksum added
	* midgard.[ch]: API for accessing Repligard added
	
2000-01-24  Alexander Bokovoy <bokovoy@minsk.lug.net>

	* Midgard is context transparent now. It means Midgard hasn't
	  changes codepage in transferred content. The only thing that
	  affected is HTML entities conversion in 'latin1' parser. But
	  for languages with several codepages (like Russian one) all
	  information is transferred on 'as-is' basis. It is important
	  for middleware position of Midgard.

	* Changed API for text formating engine. All language dependent
	  code concentrated in midgard-lib and could be controlled 
	  by MidgardParser directive in Apache's configuration file
	  at runtime on per-directory basis.
	  
	* parser.h: generalized API for supporting several text parsers,
	  implementation goes to format.c.
	  
	* parsers.h, fmt_russian.[ch]: support for russian language.
	  Parser mechanism is charset neutral itself.
	  Encoding field specifies an encoding of mail messages and
	  need_qp field selects method of Content-Transfer-Encoding.
	
	* midgard.[ch]: mgd_[v]format() functions use parser information
	  stored in midgard object, thus proper initialization of Midgard
	  engine is required. Methods for initialization/shutdown of
	  parsers added in mgd_init()/mgd_done() which should wrap
	  all midgard sessions.
	
	* INSTALL.[ru]: information about --with-midgard-lang removed.
	
2000-01-16  Alexander Bokovoy <bokovoy@minsk.lug.net>

	* midgard.[ch]: preliminary support for repositary checking
	  
2000-01-02  Alexander Bokovoy <bokovoy@minsk.lug.net>

	* Added support for selecting records by name instead of IDs.

	* Prepared for 1.2.6
		
1999-11-09  Jukka Zitting  <jukka.zitting@iki.fi>

	* Incorporated Alexander's Russian Midgard patch

	* Prepared for 1.2.5

1999-10-28 Alexander Bokovoy <bokovoy@minsk.lug.net>

	* README.ru, INSTALL.ru: Added instructions for Russian users.

1999-10-27  Alexander Bokovoy <bokovoy@minsk.lug.net>

	* format.c: Conditional compilation of HTML entities translation
	  in order to support russian language which uses straight
	  8-bit coding.

	* configure.in: New option --with-midgard-lang for basic i18n support,
	  only --with-midgard-lang=russian and --with-midgard-lang=latin1 
	  are supported for the moment. The latter is default.

1999-10-20  Jukka Zitting  <jukka.zitting@iki.fi>

	* midgard.c: The member list was not terminated properly. Fixed.

	* midgard.c: Fixed a bug in mgd_exists that broke mgd_update_person.

1999-09-29  Jukka Zitting  <jukka.zitting@iki.fi>

	* midgard.c: Fixed the mysql_fetch_field_direct problem.

1999-09-20  Jukka Zitting  <jukka.zitting@iki.fi>

	* configure.in: Better search for the MySQL library and headers.
	  Note that the options --with-mysql-lib and --with-mysql-include
	  are no longer available.

1999-09-15  Jukka Zitting  <jukka.zitting@iki.fi>

	* configure.in: Change name from midgard to midgard-lib to automate
	  package generation.

	* web.c: Removed the unused code.

1999-09-07  Jukka Zitting  <jukka.zitting@iki.fi>

	* configure.in: New options --with-mysql-lib and --with-mysql-include
	  to handle strange MySQL installation paths.

	* midgard.h, midgard.c: The midgard handle is now always created
 	  even if connection cannot be established. A client should use
	  the mgd_errno to check whether the connection succeeded.
	
1999-09-02  Jukka Zitting  <jukka.zitting@iki.fi>

	* midgard.c (mgd_vquery): removed the checking on SERVER_LOST/GONE
	  error codes as the functionality exists already in the mysql
	  client library.
	
	* midgard.c (mgd_connect): started using the mysql_real_connect
	  function for faster connections to the database

1999-08-23  Jukka Zitting  <jukka.zitting@iki.fi>

	* midgard.c (mgd_auth): Now uses the c library crypt instead of
	  the MySQL encrypt function. Also plain text passwords are now
	  supported. Such passwords are identified by the salt "**".

1999-08-23 Jukka Zitting <jukka.zitting@iki.fi>

	* midgard.h, midgard.c: midgard_connect now takes the arguments
	  database, username and password to specify the database
	  connection. Default values (defaults.h) are used if the given
 	  arguments are NULL.
	
	* configure.in: Now requires libmysqlclient to be available.
	
1999-07-13 Jukka Zitting <jukka.zitting@iki.fi>

	* configure.in: simplified the installation procedure for 1.1

	* README, AUTHORS, INSTALL, COPYING.LIB: added files to make the
	  separate lib package conform to the GNU coding standards.

	* ChangeLog: Midgard library now again a separate package. The
	  ChangeLog file of the entire Midgard package continues to live here.
	
1999-06-11 Jukka Zitting <jukka.zitting@iki.fi>

	* Many new features for 1.0.3 being finished. Work on 1.1 started.

1999-05-17 Jukka Zitting <jukka.zitting@iki.fi>

	* Approaching 1.0.2. The directory structure and installation
 	  procedure was largely reordered as there were some problems
	  with the previous releases. Midgard should now install as
	  one single package.

1999-05-08 Jukka Zitting <jukka.zitting@iki.fi>

	* Finally here: 1.0.0. Installation is now more or less smooth,
	  new features have been added and generally everything is
	  looking good.
	

1999-04-27 Jukka Zitting <jukka.zitting@iki.fi>

	* Version 0.5. Added support for Libtool, Autoconf and Automake
	  and created the NEWS, AUTHORS and ChangeLog files to comply with
	  the GNU coding standards.

	* Installation process is now a lot cleaner than before. There's
	  still work to be done though.
